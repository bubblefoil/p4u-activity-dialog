# P4U Activity dialog

The browser user script which enhances the Plus4U Activity table and dialogs.

***

## Features

### Dialogs

- Adds keyboard shorcuts to confirm the dialog by Ctrl+Enter or cancel it by Escape.
- Focuses the Activity state combo-box so it may be changed by arrow keys right away.

### Task list

- Left-click on table header opens sort menu. Tasks may actually be sorted by date. There is a context menu on the table header! Using right click in a browser to show custom pop-up menu is counter-intuitive.
- 'S' key opens the Set state dialog for highlighted Activity. (Use ⬆⬇ arrows to select an activity. Works only when the table is focused.)
- Double-clik an Activity to opent the Set state dialog.

## Installation

- Install [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net), the user script manager
 extension into your browser. [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net) is not supported.
